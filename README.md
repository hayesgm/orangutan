Prototype for under-the-covers OpenPGP encryption through a browser extension.  The core concept here is that you can select text in a text area, choose "Encrypt" and choose participants to encrypt a message for.  The message will be in the form of a URI, which can be shared on sites, such as Facebook.  When other browsers with the Chrome extension installed see an "encrypted"-URL in a text-node on a page, they will run a decode algorithm on the message to seamlessly decrypt the message.  The idea is that you could share your public key through Facebook or other social networks, and paste encrpyted messages as URIs or photographs with specific EXIF.
